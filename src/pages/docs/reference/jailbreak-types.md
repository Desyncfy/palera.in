# Jailbreak Types
All jailbreaks are different in some way, one of the main differentiations between jailbreaks is their "jailbreak type" which change their overall main behavior when trying to re-jailbreak or jailbreak initially.

> **Palera1n is a [semi-tethered](#semi-tethered) jailbreak**, and has been ever since version `2.0.0 beta`. Version 1.x allowed tethered jailbreaking without needing any additional storage but it was often problematic due to the side effects of being tethered.

## Tethered
Tethered describes the process of always requiring some sort of external computer to be able to **boot** the device. This requires user input.

> When its [tethered](#tethered), when trying to boot it will either be stuck [Recovery](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/RecoveryMode) mode or [DFU](https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/DFU_Mode) mode. Requiring you to do the previous commands you did originally to boot.

## Semi-tethered
Semi-tethered describes the process of requiring a jailbreak to boot jailbroken, while allowing the device to boot on its own without any external devices. This requires user input.

## Untethered
Untethered describes the process of your device automatically booting jailbroken on its own when booting. This requires no user input.

> When using an untethered jailbreak, theres risks where a tweak you've installed can prevent you from booting. These type of jailbreaks usually have a safety feature to boot without tweaks so you're able to use your device again.

## Semi-untethered
Semi-untethered is similar to [semi-tethered](#semi-tethered), but you're not required to use a computer to jailbreak, rather, you're able to jailbreak with an application on your device. This requires user input.

> Theres some cases where you'll have the ability to permanently sideload the app on your device without needing a jailbreak, though this *does not* mean that the jailbreak is *untethered*,

All these terms also apply to when restoring a device.<br/><br/>Normally restores are untethered, but effects like semi-tethered can also be applied when you're bypassing signature checks when trying to boot an older version of *OS. (Semi-untethered downgrading is not possible.)
